# YouTube Clone Web Application

- This project is created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

- I have created a YouTube clone using `React.js`, `Tailwind CSS`, `Redux Toolkit`, `React-router`, and `YouTube APIs`.
- I have used `YouTube APIs` to fetch live data from the server. 
- You can go through my code. It's very simple, readable, and understandable  code.
- You can use it for your learning project.
